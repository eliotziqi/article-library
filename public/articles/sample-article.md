# Welcome to the Article Library

This sample article illustrates how Markdown is rendered in the application. It includes several
typical elements you may rely on when writing long-form documentation.

## Key Features

- **Headings** from level one through level three
- Paragraph text with thoughtful spacing
- Inline code such as `npm install` for command snippets
- Syntax highlighted code blocks

```
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('reader'))
```

## Pull quotes

> Great documentation is just like great storytelling—it guides the reader with clarity and
> intentional structure.

### Next steps

1. Replace this Markdown file with your own content.
2. Add more routes that map to additional articles.
3. Polish the styling to match your brand.
